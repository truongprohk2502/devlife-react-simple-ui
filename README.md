# DevLife React Simple UI

This is a very light UI components library for ReactJS.
It's using TailwindCSS for styling.

You can also view the demo and get the source code directly for each component without installing this library.

- [Demo](https://dev-life-solution.netlify.app/ui-components)

```js
/*
 ** In root app file: main.ts
 ** Import style.css file
 */
import "devlife-react-simple-ui/dist/style.css";

// ...
```
